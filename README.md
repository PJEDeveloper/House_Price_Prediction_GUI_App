üìò Description  
This project is an end-to-end House Price Prediction System using machine learning. It includes data preprocessing, model training, inference, and a graphical user interface (GUI) for user interaction. It is built in Python using TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, and Tkinter, and structured to work with time-series housing data at the county level.

üìä Overview
1. Data Preprocessing (preprocessing.py)
Transforms raw county-level housing CSV data into a time-series format suitable for machine learning. It also generates metadata and logs all operations.

2. Model Training (house_price_predicting_mlm_v6_FT.py)
Trains deep learning regression models using TensorFlow/Keras for each county (target feature) using the rest as predictors. Includes:

Feature and target scaling

Model architecture definition

Early stopping and learning rate reduction

Model and metrics saving

3. Inference (inference.py)
A command-line interface to perform predictions for a selected county using the trained model. It automatically identifies top predictors and scales inputs accordingly.

4. Graphical User Interface (hpp_gui.py)
Provides a user-friendly Tkinter-based GUI for house price prediction, allowing selection of a county and input of relevant predictors. It dynamically updates input fields based on feature correlation.

üåü Key Features
‚úÖ General
Modular architecture with centralized configuration via config_utils.

Dynamic metadata and logging for traceability.

Compatible with GPU acceleration (TensorFlow GPU support).

üìÇ preprocessing.py
Validates and sanitizes column names.

Handles missing values using median imputation.

Converts wide-form time series data into long-form format.

Exports processed data to Excel and metadata to JSON.

Logging of each preprocessing step for debugging and reproducibility.

üß† house_price_predicting_mlm_v6_FT.py
Automatically detects and trains a model for each county.

Uses a dense neural network with L2 regularization and dropout for generalization.

Stores models, scalers, and evaluation metrics (RMSE, R¬≤).

Implements early stopping and adaptive learning rate scheduling.

üñ•Ô∏è hpp_gui.py
Full-featured Tkinter GUI for non-technical users.

Automatically shows the most relevant predictor features per selected county.

Provides user input validation and error handling.

Displays prediction results clearly with explanations.

üõ†Ô∏è inference.py
CLI-based prediction interface for script-based usage.

Auto-selects top 10 predictors based on correlation.

Supports manual input with fallback to default values.

Full logging of prediction steps for transparency.
